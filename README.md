In order for this to run properly in an IDE, make sure to have an mysql-connector-java-8.0.26 jar file.

This file can be downloaded at the following: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

At the moment, github refused to take the jar file because of its size. This jar file was NOT made by us and was already provided for mySQL connection


1. Go to the https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ website, then choose the OS for your machine and download that specific connector. 
2. Once this connector is downloaded, you must open BluJ
          2a. Click on Tools
          2b. Click on Preferences
          2c. Click on the Libraries Tab
          2d. CLick add file
          2e. Choose the sql connector file that you just downloaded
          2f. Click apply/Ok
3. Should Run!
